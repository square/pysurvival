## What is Pysurvival ?
PySurvival is an open source python package for Survival Analysis modeling - *the modeling concept used to analyze or predict when an event is likely to happen*. It is built upon the most commonly used machine learning packages such [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

PySurvival is compatible with Python 2.7-3.7.

## Content
PySurvival provides a very easy way to navigate between theoretical knowledge on Survival Analysis and detailed tutorials on how to conduct a full analysis, build and use a model. Indeed, the package contains:

* 10+ models ranging from the [Cox Proportional Hazard model](https://www.pysurvival.io/models/coxph.html), the [Neural Multi-Task Logistic Regression](https://www.pysurvival.io/models/neural_mtlr.html) to [Random Survival Forest](https://www.pysurvival.io/models/random_survival_forest.html)
* Summaries of the theory behind each model as well as API descriptions and examples.
* Tutorials displaying in great details how to perform exploratory data analysis, survival modeling, cross-validation and prediction, for [churn modeling](https://www.pysurvival.io/tutorials/churn.html) and [credit risk](https://www.pysurvival.io/tutorials/credit_risk.html) to name a few.
* Performance metrics to assess the models' abilities like [c-index](https://www.pysurvival.io/metrics/c_index.html) or [brier score](https://www.pysurvival.io/metrics/brier_score.html)
* Simple ways to [load and save models](https://www.pysurvival.io/miscellaneous/save_load.html)
* ... and more !

## Installation

If you have already installed a working version of gcc, the easiest way to install Pysurvival is using pip
```
pip install pysurvival
```
Alternatively, it can be done via conda:
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pysurvival
```
The full description of the installation steps can be found [here](https://www.pysurvival.io/installation.html).

## Get Started

Because of its simple API, Pysurvival has been built to provide to best user experience when it comes to modeling.
Here's a quick modeling example to get you started:

```python
# Loading the modules
from pysurvival.models.semi_parametric import CoxPHModel
from pysurvival.models.multi_task import LinearMultiTaskModel
from pysurvival.datasets import Dataset
from pysurvival.utils.metrics import concordance_index

# Loading and splitting a simple example into train/test sets
X_train, T_train, E_train, X_test, T_test, E_test = \
	Dataset('simple_example').load_train_test()

# Building a CoxPH model
coxph_model = CoxPHModel()
coxph_model.fit(X=X_train, T=T_train, E=E_train, init_method='he_uniform', 
                l2_reg = 1e-4, lr = .4, tol = 1e-4)

# Building a MTLR model
mtlr = LinearMultiTaskModel()
mtlr.fit(X=X_train, T=T_train, E=E_train, init_method = 'glorot_uniform', 
           optimizer ='adam', lr = 8e-4)

# Checking the model performance
c_index1 = concordance_index(model=coxph_model, X=X_test, T=T_test, E=E_test )
print("CoxPH model c-index = {:.2f}".format(c_index1))

c_index2 = concordance_index(model=mtlr, X=X_test, T=T_test, E=E_test )
print("MTLR model c-index = {:.2f}".format(c_index2))
```
